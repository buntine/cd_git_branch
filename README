CD GIT BRANCH THINGO
--------------------

WHAT?
-----

This is a simple "cd" replacement that will warn you if you've just changed into a directory that:

0) Is the root of a Git repository.
1) Is not currently on the master branch.


WHY?
----

Because I always fuck this up and start working in the wrong branch.


INSTALL
-------

0) Checkout repo
1) Setup symlink to cd_git script so it's on your PATH:
   $ ln -s /path/to/cd_git /usr/bin/cd_git
2) Add the contents of cd.bash into your ~/.profile (or equivalent depending on OS: ~/.bashrc sometimes, etc)
3) Open a new terminal or $ source ~/.profile


UNINSTALL
---------

Just remove the contents of cd.bash from your ~/.bashrc
